# SACK CVE Fixer

This is a tool created by [SentinelOne](https://www.sentinelone.com/) to apply workarounds for the [netflix's SACK CVEs](https://thenextweb.com/security/2019/06/17/netflix-fixes-potentially-devastating-linux-sack-vulnerability/), to secure your Linux systems until they are patched.

## The vulnerability

You can read more about the vulnerability on our [blog](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/grab-our-free-tool-linux-sack-panic/).

## Usage

To check if your Linux system is vulnerable, run: 
```
$ sudo ./sack_cve_fixer.sh check
```
It will output to which CVE's your system is vulnerable.


To apply the workarounds, run:
```
$ sudo ./sack_cve_fixer.sh install
```

It will also apply persistence, to ensure your system is safe after a reboot as well.

If any of the workarounds will fail, you'll get a notice.



## Restore

If you'd like to restore the system modifications, run the script `./restore.sh` which was generated on the installation process.
